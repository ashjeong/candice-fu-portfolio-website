Created by [ashjeong](https://github.com/ashjeong) & [magandren](https://github.com/magandren) for [Candice Fu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candice-fu/).

This project is a re-work of a previously created website with low responsiveness and broken views when viewing on smaller screens.

## Setup

Run the setup script to install all dependencies:

```bash
